::: {#intro}
I'm a computational disease ecologist studying how individual heterogeneity and spatial structure generate rare but consequential events—from superspreading to pathogen emergence hotspots. I integrate mechanistic models, spatial analysis, and decision science to understand disease transmission, with focus on creative solutions to the data limitations common in emerging disease systems globally.

Born in Chile and raised in Ecuador, I discovered infectious disease ecology while pursuing veterinary medicine and fell in love with our ability to model complex ecological systems through equations. I hold a PhD in Zoology from UF (advisors: Jose Miguel Ponciano and Bette Loiselle) and completed postdoctoral training at USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and UF's Emerging Pathogens Institute.

Currently, I'm a tenure-track Computational Literacy Librarian at UF focusing on developing a program in data and AI literacy. As a 2026 Global Fellow, I am building international collaborations and computational capacity across Latin America, with a focus on the ecology of infectious diseases. My goal is to strengthen computational understanding among ecology graduate students and support fellow faculty in the process.

I'm also a mom of three kiddos and one fantastic dog. First-generation college student, Latina, immigrant.
