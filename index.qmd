Hi there! My name is Francisca Javiera (Javi) Rudolph and this is my mini website. I primarily use this one to organize my GitHub work and share things I learn that apply to R programming or data science. For details on my background and research in quantitative ecology please visit my [other site at javirudolph.com/research](https://www.javirudolph.com/research)
