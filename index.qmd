::: {#intro}
I'm a computational disease ecologist studying how individual heterogeneity and spatial structure generate rare but consequential events from superspreading to pathogen emergence hotspots. Currently, I am a tenure-track Computational Literacy Librarian at UF, building international collaborations and computational capacity across Latin America.
