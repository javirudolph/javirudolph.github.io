My research explores how **individual heterogeneity and spatial
structure generate rare but consequential events** that
disproportionately shape ecological and epidemiological dynamics. I'm
driven by understanding nature through numbers—finding creative
solutions when faced with data limitations, uncertainty, or complex
systems that resist traditional approaches.

I'm model-agnostic: I select the best tool for the question rather than
adhering to a single framework. My toolkit spans extreme value
statistics, Bayesian hierarchical models, spatially-explicit
simulations, machine learning, and decision science. I'm committed to
open science, and when I have a say, my work is publicly available with
annotated code on [GitHub](https://github.com/javirudolph).

## Research Themes

### Individual Heterogeneity & Superspreading Events

\![Add image: simulation output or conceptual diagram\]

A few highly mobile or highly connected individuals drive
disproportionate outcomes—whether seed dispersal or pathogen
transmission. My dissertation established methods for characterizing
individual heterogeneity in animal movement using **extreme value
theory**, quantifying not average behavior but tail dynamics that
generate rare long-distance dispersal events.

This framework translates directly to disease systems: superspreaders
exist in the tail of movement or contact distributions. I'm formalizing
this through integration of **integrated step selection analysis** with
transmission modeling in deer populations, asking: When does
heterogeneity amplify versus dampen outbreak risk? How do landscape
features interact with movement heterogeneity? Can movement-based early
warning systems predict spillover?

**Future directions:** Reinforcement learning for surveillance
optimization—identifying which individuals, populations, and landscape
positions maximize information about emergence risk when resources are
limited.

**Key collaborations:** Universidad San Francisco de Quito (Ecuador),
Universidad Austral (Chile)

### Hybrid Inference for Resource-Limited Surveillance

Mechanistic epidemiological models need fine-scale data. Real-world
surveillance produces yearly case totals, aggregated counts, or
opportunistic observations. I develop **hybrid frameworks** integrating
statistical inference, data augmentation, and mechanistic simulations to
bridge this gap.

**Demonstrated systems:** - **Anthrax in Vietnam:** Semi-synthetic data
augmentation fitting mechanistic models to yearly totals ([*One Health*,
2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771425003301)) -
**White-nose syndrome in Montana:** Structured decision-making under
deep uncertainty through stakeholder engagement (*in review*) -
**SARS-CoV-2 in deer:** Spatially-explicit stochastic epidemic models
([*PLOS Computational Bio*,
2024](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012263))

**Future work:** Generalizing to multi-host, multi-pathogen One Health
systems. Through my **Global Fellows Award**, I'm formalizing
international partnerships in Chile and Ecuador where researchers face
exactly these data challenges. NSF STAR proposal in development to
position UF as hemispheric hub for computational disease ecology
capacity building.

### Landscape Geometry as Active Driver of Transmission

\![Add image: Amazonian earthworks satellite imagery or geometric

Classical disease ecology treats landscape as passive backdrop. I'm
developing frameworks positioning **landscape geometry**—fractal
dimension, patch configuration, edge density—as an active transmission
driver.

In collaboration with Dr. Nicolas Gauthier (Florida Museum), we use
**vision-language models** to extract geometric features from Amazonian
satellite imagery and incorporate them into spatially-explicit SIR
models. Critically, this is **bidirectional**: simulate forward
(landscape → disease patterns) and work backward through inverse
modeling (disease dynamics → geometric signatures).

This positions landscape geometry as an inferential target rather than
requiring exhaustive field surveys—essential for tropical systems where
satellite imagery is abundant but disease surveillance remains sparse.

**Future applications:** Vector-borne diseases in fragmented forests,
zoonotic spillover at urban-wildland interfaces, waterborne diseases in
canal systems. NSF HEGS and eMB proposals in development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Metacommunity Theory Meets Disease Ecology

\![Add image: JSDM diagram or multi-species network\]

For several years I've explored parallels between metacommunity ecology
and disease ecology: treating pathogens as ecological communities
subject to assembly rules across host metacommunities.

I have extensive experience with **joint species distribution models
(JSDMs)**, publishing on [metacommunity
theory](https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/oik.08618)
and currently leading work exploring how variance in dispersal across
species affects community assembly and whether JSDMs can detect these
differences. I also co-teach the *Advanced Ecology: Theory and
Computational Methods* course with Dr. Mathew Leibold.

This framework enables surveillance optimization: by modeling pathogens
probabilistically across host communities, we identify which species and
populations maximize information about pathogen community structure when
comprehensive monitoring is prohibitively expensive.

**Application:** Multi-host zoonotic systems where dozens of pathogen
strains circulate but resources are limited.

## Methodological Journey

My quantitative training spans probability theory to complex
hierarchical models to machine learning. During my **PhD** (UF
Biology/Zoology), I used simulation techniques, bootstrap corrections,
and extreme value statistics—while also supporting colleagues on moss
genetics and ant-butterfly mutualisms.

My **first postdoc** (USGS Patuxent) brought Bayesian hierarchical
models, occupancy modeling, and mark-recapture methods. My **second
postdoc** (UF Emerging Pathogens Institute) integrated mechanistic
models with machine learning and AI applications.

Currently, as **Computational Literacy Librarian** at UF, I'm building
capacity for quantitative approaches across disciplines—teaching
Advanced Ecology Methods, developing reproducible research frameworks,
and creating open educational resources. This role provides unique
freedom to establish international collaborations that benefit entire
research communities rather than individual projects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Computational Capacity Building

Through my **2026 Global Fellows Award**, I'm establishing training
networks across Latin America with the mission to:

-   Build local computational infrastructure that persists beyond
    individual collaborations

-   Develop workshops and educational materials tailored to
    resource-limited contexts

-   Create equitable partnerships where UF serves as hemispheric hub

I'm developing workshops for Ecuador (July 2026) and Chile (December
2026) on computational disease ecology, designed for variable
computational access. Materials will be open-source and available to UF
students as well.

I'm also mentoring two undergraduate researchers in Spring 2026: one
developing an OER module on SIR models and disease ecology, another
creating reproducible research templates in R and GitHub in
collaboration with Environmental and Global Health Department at UF.

## Open Science Commitment

Most of my work is publicly available with annotated code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/javirudolph). I've promoted reproducibility in ecology for years and
develop materials emphasizing transparent, reproducible workflows.
Exceptions occur when data are regulated by government agencies or I'm
not primary owner, but transparency is my default.
