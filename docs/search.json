    "text": "I have taught multiple workshops to help researchers get started with version control and GitHub, but never had materials online. Part of this is that most of my workshops are hands-on, taught live, and with exercises that occur in the moment. I usually start with a few slides that give an intro to version control and why we want to use it, but after this, learners go straight into submitting issues and creating their first commits. I also think there are amazing blogs out there with good information already, so creating yet another one felt redundant. Anyways, as a personal challenge, I wrote yet another blog on Git and Github. I tried to keep it simple and straightforward, think of it as a brief overview to get your toes wet with version control.\n\nWhat is Git?\nVersion control system which essentially keeps track of a group of files and their history. You could think of it as the phylogenetic tree of your files.\nA repository is a collection of files within a group that gets tracked together.\n\n\nWhy Github?\nGithub, GitLab, and BitBucket are all similar and they provide hosting services, which is basically a home for your project on the internet.\nIt‚Äôs like having a DropBox or GoogleDrive but for git-based projects, which for the most part is related to code.\nThis allows other people to see your stuff, synchronize it, and contribute. Maybe think of it as the social media of code (but if you are not a fan of social media, then forget this analogy).\n\n\nBut whyyyyyy‚Ä¶?\nAt least for academia, I have noticed people use GitHub as a code storage place - essentially, you write a paper, have some code associated with it, upload the code and use that link for the Data availability section in the manuscript. I don‚Äôt love this, but if it means the code is available, I‚Äôll take it.\nFor long-term code storage (you publish a paper and share the code/data for it) I think Zenodo is a great option! There are other options too, like Open Science Framework and both of these integrate with GitHub. So, you could start your project with Git/GitHub, track all the changes, and then when finished, release it as a version to Zenodo. This is what I did for my dissertation.\nSo, why do I love Git and GitHub? It is a relatively simple step to keeping us honest. I push for reproducibility in science, and open source work, and using version control is one aspect of this. I also think this is an great resource and learning tool for young scientists! Personally, I have learned much more from people‚Äôs repositories of their analysis, than from papers that just tell you what they did, but don‚Äôt show you how. Also, I think it is important to have tools that allow for real-time collaboration, where we can not only work together, but also openly discuss changes and keep track of why decisions were made.\n\n\nSome Github features (the website)\n\nWell-designed user interface\nIssues originally a bug tracker but highly underutilized in our fields. I love these, as they provide a nice way to keep track of comments and conversation around specific files or problems with your code.\nR and Github integration is nicer due to the active R package development community (personal opinion). An intro on this can be found here\n\n\n\nHow to work with Git and Github?\nFor the R user, best simple straightforward resource out there is Happy git with R\nGithub itself has a dedicated section for learning in the docs and in particular, the Hello World tutorial will get you creating a repo, managing a branch and merging a pull request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\n\nBranches and pull requests\nWhen you first start using Git and Github, thinking of branches might feel a little intimidating, and honestly, you can get away with no using them at first. But branches become essential once you get a little adventurous and try things that could break your code. They are also incredible useful for working with others and keeping track of everyone‚Äôs contributions to the project.\n\nCreate Branch to make a change.\nCommit changes to the new branch.\nOpen Pull request to merge the changes to main branch.\nOptional and recommended: delete branch\n\nAlso known as a feature branch workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource https://www.nobledesktop.com/learn/git/git-branches\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Quarto?\nThis website and blog post are created with Quarto and edited from RStudio! If you are familiar with R markdown, then think of Quarto as the next generation, which allows you to work not only with R, but also python and julia. It is an open source publishing system (It helps you create pretty documents using code and text), and you can create anything from a website to a power point presentation, and even a pre-formatted scientific manuscript.\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\n\nWhat are we doing today?\nIn previous workshops, I have created repositories specific to the group or organization that I‚Äôll be working with. Sometimes the repo I create stays with the organization or sometimes I just delete it. For the sake of this tutorial‚Äôs posterity, I created github-practice repo. Let‚Äôs take a look at some tasks then:\n\nIf you don‚Äôt already have one, create a free GitHub account.\nLocate the github-practice repo and create an issue to propose a change, create a to do list, or add a description.\nCreate a new branch called yourname-add for you to create a change to any of the files.\nOpen a pull request to suggest your changes be included into the main branch.\n\nThere you have it! Your first interaction with GitHub ü§© and you have [Registered for a GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct)\nWhat do you think your next step should be? Perhaps you could get started by linking your local R/RStudio to your brand new GitHub account!\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{rudolph2025,\n  author = {Rudolph, Francisca Javiera},\n  title = {Why {I} Love {Git} and {GitHub}},\n  date = {2025-02-20},\n  url = {https://javirudolph.github.io/posts/2025-02-20-git-and-github/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRudolph, Francisca Javiera. 2025. ‚ÄúWhy I Love Git and\nGitHub.‚Äù February 20, 2025. https://javirudolph.github.io/posts/2025-02-20-git-and-github/."

    "text": "I wrote this post to help a friend a couple of years ago (og post), and I am finally getting to organize this into my brand new website! ü§©\nAt the time, Sarah was working on her dissertation with salamanders and the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). Specifically, we talked about generating dispersal kernels for the pathogen, thinking of humans walking on trails and carrying the pathogen on their boots. Sarah did some really fun experiments getting boots in the mud and taking steps, to quantify the amount of pathogen that would get onto the boots, and then dispersed by a person walking.\nWhen you have available data, the usual goal is to fit an equation (or model) that describes the probability of dispersal as a function of distance. In this case, we are thinking of human mediated dispersal (HMD) of a specific fungal pathogen. The experiments were used to calculate the amount of pathogen that gets dispersed in hiking books after being exposed to an initial inoculum. The starting inoculum had a concentration of 10^5 zoospores in water. Boots step on the inoculated water source, and walk for s meters, where s=1,2,...,5. In this example we were trying to quantify the dispersal kernel for human mediated spore dispersal.\nThe main question here is over what range of distances can fungal spores be dispersed by humans on their boots? And what function would describe the relationship between concentration of those spores and distance walked.\nFrom the initial meeting with Sarah, I understood that we start with 10^5 zoospores in a water vessel, and essentially estimate a pick up rate. This means that data points at distance zero (d=0) are a proportion of the initial starter. From here, we would like to estimate the proportion of zoospores left on the shoe vector, and thus the proportion of zoospores transferred to the soil as distance from the starter increases.\nA common approach to this is to use an exponential model with:\nf(d) = a \\text{e}^{-bd}\nwhere the proportion of zoospores left on the boot (f(d)) is a function of the initial number of zoospores at the starting point (in this case the pick up rate as a proportion of the total at distance d=0). We assume that zoospores are transferred from the boot to the soil at a constant rate b, as shown in the equation above.\nFor algebra reasons:\n\ny = a \\text{e}^{-bx} \\\\\nlog(y) = log(a \\cdot \\text{e}^{-bx}) \\\\\nlog(y) = log(a) + log(\\text{e}^{-bx}) \\\\\nlog(y) = A - bx\n\nTo fit this model in R, you can just fit a linear model, where your response variable is log(y), with an intercept A, and a slope -b.\nAs an example, let‚Äôs generate some random data from the perspective of this experiment. The starting point:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n# From what I remember these seemed to be the average values\n# for the number of zoospores\n# recovered from the boot\ny_mean &lt;- c(160, 100, 60, 20, 5, 2)\ny_sd &lt;- c(0, 30, 10, 5, 5, 5)\n\n# And these are the number of data points for each of the distances\nd &lt;- c(0,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,5)\n\nset.seed(86923)\n#simulate some data\ny &lt;- NULL\nfor(i in 1:length(d)){\n  val_d &lt;- d[i]\n  gen_y &lt;- rnorm(1, mean = y_mean[val_d+1], sd = y_sd[val_d+1])\n  y[i] &lt;- gen_y\n}\n\nplot(d, y)\n\n\n\n\nWe have some simulated data now, and now will fit an exponential function to it:\n\n# Save my simulated data as an object\nmy_df &lt;- data.frame(d = d, y = y)\n\n# The model looks at the proportion of zoospores that remain on the boot\npick_up &lt;- my_df$y[which(my_df$d==0)] # number of zoospores picked up from source\n\nmy_df |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_y = y/pick_up) -&gt; my_df\n\n# plot(my_df$d, my_df$prop_y)\n\n# Fit the function as a linear model:\n\nm1 &lt;- lm(log(prop_y) ~ d, data = my_df)\nbroom::tidy(m1)\n\n# A tibble: 2 √ó 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic      p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    0.326    0.213       1.53 0.149       \n2 d             -0.774    0.0690    -11.2  0.0000000221\n\n\nWe can look at the results from this model and see that the intercept (a) is giving us the starting value for d=0, for the proportion of zoospores remaining on the boot. Considering this is in a log scale, we transform back to get the actual proportion:\n\nexp(m1$coefficients[1])\n\n(Intercept) \n   1.385001 \n\n\nBut we also have to remember that this is a proportion of zoospores remaining given the initial pickup rate. So to get an actual number of zoospores at a certain distance, in this case d=0, we have to multiply by the initial pick up rate and we get\n\nexp(m1$coefficients[1]) * pick_up\n\n(Intercept) \n   221.6001 \n\n\nas the number of zoospores picked up by the boot at the source. This model assumes a constant decay rate -0.7742497, which corresponds to b.\nWe can use these coefficients to predict the proportion of zoospores remaining on the boot at any given distance d. For example:\n\n# predictions vector\nd_pred &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 10, by = 0.5) # in meters\n\n# Use the model to generate predictions for these new distance values\ny_log_pred &lt;- predict(m1, list(d = d_pred))\n# transform back to get proportions\ny_pred_prop &lt;- exp(y_log_pred)\n\n# transform to number of zoospores using the initial pick up rate\ny_pred&lt;- y_pred_prop * pick_up\n\n# Get one data frame to visualize\npred_df &lt;- data.frame(d = d_pred, y = y_pred, prop_y = y_pred_prop, type = \"pred\")\n\n\n#| warning: false\n\nmy_df |&gt; \n  mutate(type = \"og\") |&gt; \n  bind_rows(pred_df) -&gt; combined_df\n\ncombined_df |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = d, y = y, color = type)) +\n   geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n   theme_classic() +\n  labs(y = \"Zoospores on boot\", x = \"Distance in meters\") -&gt; nzoos_fig\n\n\ncombined_df |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = d, y = prop_y, color = type)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(y = \"Proportion of zoospores remaining on boot\",\n       x = \"Distance in meters\",\n       color = \"\") -&gt; prop_fig\n\nmy_legend &lt;- cowplot::get_legend(prop_fig)\n\nWarning in get_plot_component(plot, \"guide-box\"): Multiple components found;\nreturning the first one.

In our case, it tells us 93.2% of the variation in the proportion of zoospores remaining on the boot is explained by the distance variable.\nTo wrap up, if we consider the model:\n\ny = a\\text{e}^{-bx}\n where y is the proportion of zoospores that remain on the boot and x is the distance in meters from the source of the pathogen, then a tells us the starting number of zoospores picked up by the boot at the source, and b tells us the rate at which zoospores are transferred from the boot to the soil.\nIf we use the second model‚Äôs values, then we can ask the question, what proportion of zoospores would remain on the hiker‚Äôs boot after walking for 20 meters?\n\na &lt;- summary(m2)$coefficients[1]\nb &lt;- summary(m2)$coefficients[2]\n\nget_prop_y &lt;- function(x, a, b){\n  a*exp(b*x)\n}\n\n\nget_prop_y(20, a, b)\n\n[1] 1.243764e-05\n\n\nthis should be the same result using the predict() function:\n\npredict(m2, list(d = 20))\n\n[1] 1.243764e-05\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{rudolph2023,\n  author = {Rudolph, Francisca Javiera},\n  title = {Vector-Mediated Dispersal Kernels},\n  date = {2023-02-13},\n  url = {https://javirudolph.github.io/posts/2023-02-13-on-dispersal-kernels/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRudolph, Francisca Javiera. 2023. ‚ÄúVector-Mediated Dispersal\nKernels.‚Äù February 13, 2023. https://javirudolph.github.io/posts/2023-02-13-on-dispersal-kernels/."
