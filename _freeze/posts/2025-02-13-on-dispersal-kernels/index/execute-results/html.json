Specifically, we talked about generating dispersal kernels for the pathogen, thinking of humans walking on trails and carrying the pathogen on their boots. Sarah did some really fun experiments getting boots in the mud and taking steps, to quantify the amount of pathogen that would get onto the boots, and then dispersed by a person walking.\n\nWhen you have available data, the usual goal is to fit an equation (or model) that describes the probability of dispersal as a function of distance. In this case, we are thinking of human mediated dispersal (HMD) of a specific fungal pathogen. The experiments were used to calculate the amount of pathogen that gets dispersed in hiking books after being exposed to an initial inoculum. The starting inoculum had a concentration of $10^5$ zoospores in water. Boots step on the inoculated water source, and walk for $s$ meters, where $s=1,2,...,5$. In this example we were trying to quantify the dispersal kernel for human mediated spore dispersal.\n\n**The main question here is over what range of distances can fungal spores be dispersed by humans on their boots? And what function would describe the relationship between concentration of those spores and distance walked.**\n\nFrom the initial meeting with Sarah, I understood that we start with $10^5$ zoospores in a water vessel, and essentially estimate a pick up rate. This means that data points at distance zero ($d=0$) are a proportion of the initial starter. From here, we would like to estimate the proportion of zoospores left on the shoe vector, and thus the proportion of zoospores transferred to the soil as distance from the starter increases.\n\nA common approach to this is to use an exponential model with:\n\n$$f(d) = a \\text{e}^{-bd}$$\n\nwhere the proportion of zoospores left on the boot ($f(d)$) is a function of the initial number of zoospores at the starting point (in this case the pick up rate as a proportion of the total at distance $d=0$). We *assume* that zoospores are transferred from the boot to the soil at a constant rate $b$, as shown in the equation above.\n\nFor algebra reasons:\n\n$$\ny = a \\text{e}^{-bx} \\\\\nlog(y) = log(a \\cdot \\text{e}^{-bx}) \\\\\nlog(y) = log(a) + log(\\text{e}^{-bx}) \\\\\nlog(y) = A - bx\n$$\n\nTo fit this model in R, you can just fit a linear model, where your response variable is $log(y)$, with an intercept $A$, and a slope $-b$.\n\nAs an example, let's generate some random data from the perspective of this experiment. The starting point:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# From what I remember these seemed to be the average values\n# for the number of zoospores\n# recovered from the boot\ny_mean <- c(160, 100, 60, 20, 5, 2)\ny_sd <- c(0, 30, 10, 5, 5, 5)\n\n# And these are the number of data points for each of the distances\nd <- c(0,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,5)\n\nset.seed(86923)\n#simulate some data\ny <- NULL\nfor(i in 1:length(d)){\n  val_d <- d[i]\n  gen_y <- rnorm(1, mean = y_mean[val_d+1], sd = y_sd[val_d+1])\n  y[i] <- gen_y\n}\n\nplot(d, y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe have some simulated data now, and now will fit an exponential function to it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Save my simulated data as an object\nmy_df <- data.frame(d = d, y = y)\n\n# The model looks at the proportion of zoospores that remain on the boot\npick_up <- my_df$y[which(my_df$d==0)] # number of zoospores picked up from source\n\nmy_df |> \n  mutate(prop_y = y/pick_up) -> my_df\n\n# plot(my_df$d, my_df$prop_y)\n\n# Fit the function as a linear model:\n\nm1 <- lm(log(prop_y) ~ d, data = my_df)\nbroom::tidy(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 Ã— 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic      p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>        <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)    0.326    0.213       1.53 0.149       \n2 d             -0.774    0.0690    -11.2  0.0000000221\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can look at the results from this model and see that the intercept ($a$) is giving us the starting value for $d=0$, for the proportion of zoospores remaining on the boot. Considering this is in a log scale, we transform back to get the actual proportion:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp(m1$coefficients[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(Intercept) \n   1.385001 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut we also have to remember that this is a proportion of zoospores remaining given the initial pickup rate. So to get an actual number of zoospores at a certain distance, in this case $d=0$, we have to multiply by the initial pick up rate and we get\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp(m1$coefficients[1]) * pick_up\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(Intercept) \n   221.6001 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nas the number of zoospores picked up by the boot at the source. This model assumes a constant decay rate -0.7742497, which corresponds to $b$.\n\nWe can use these coefficients to predict the proportion of zoospores remaining on the boot at any given distance $d$. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# predictions vector\nd_pred <- seq(from = 2, to = 10, by = 0.5) # in meters\n\n# Use the model to generate predictions for these new distance values\ny_log_pred <- predict(m1, list(d = d_pred))\n# transform back to get proportions\ny_pred_prop <- exp(y_log_pred)\n\n# transform to number of zoospores using the initial pick up rate\ny_pred<- y_pred_prop * pick_up\n\n# Get one data frame to visualize\npred_df <- data.frame(d = d_pred, y = y_pred, prop_y = y_pred_prop, type = \"pred\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#| warning: false\n\nmy_df |> \n  mutate(type = \"og\") |> \n  bind_rows(pred_df) -> combined_df\n\ncombined_df |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = d, y = y, color = type)) +\n   geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n   theme_classic() +\n  labs(y = \"Zoospores on boot\", x = \"Distance in meters\") -> nzoos_fig\n\n\ncombined_df |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = d, y = prop_y, color = type)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(y = \"Proportion of zoospores remaining on boot\",\n       x = \"Distance in meters\",\n       color = \"\") -> prop_fig\n\nmy_legend <- cowplot::get_legend(prop_fig)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in get_plot_component(plot, \"guide-box\"): Multiple components found;\nreturning the first one.
